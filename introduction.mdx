## Key Capabilities

### Code When You Need It

Switch seamlessly between visual workflow building and code. Write JavaScript or Python, add npm packages, or use the intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

```javascript
// Execute custom JavaScript in Code nodes
const items = $input.all();

return items.map(item => ({
  json: {
    ...item.json,
    processed: true,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  }
}));
```

### AI-Native Platform

Build AI agent workflows based on LangChain with your own data and models. n8n includes dedicated AI nodes and tools for creating intelligent automation.

## What Does "n8n" Mean?

**Short answer:** It means "nodemation" (node + automation) and is pronounced as **n-eight-n**.

**Long answer:** While looking for a good name for the project, founder Jan Oberhauser realized all the good domain names were taken. He chose "nodemation" - 'node-' representing the Node-View interface and Node.js technology, and '-mation' for 'automation'. To make it shorter and easier to type in the CLI, he shortened it to 'n8n'.
