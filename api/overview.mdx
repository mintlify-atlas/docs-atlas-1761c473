---

## Introduction

n8n provides a comprehensive REST API that allows you to programmatically manage workflows, executions, credentials, and other resources. The API is designed to be intuitive and follows RESTful principles.

## Base URL

The API is accessible at your n8n instance URL:

```
https://your-n8n-instance.com/api/v1
```

## API Versions

n8n currently supports:

- **Public API (v1)**: `/api/v1/*` - Designed for external integrations
- **Internal API**: Used by the n8n frontend application

<Note>
This documentation focuses on the Public API endpoints that are stable and recommended for external use.
</Note>

## Core Resources

The n8n API provides access to these core resources:

### Workflows
Create, read, update, and delete workflows. Activate and deactivate workflow automation.

```
POST   /api/v1/workflows          # Create workflow
GET    /api/v1/workflows          # List workflows
GET    /api/v1/workflows/:id      # Get workflow
PATCH  /api/v1/workflows/:id      # Update workflow
DELETE /api/v1/workflows/:id      # Delete workflow
```

### Executions
Monitor workflow executions, check their status, and manage running workflows.

```
GET    /api/v1/executions         # List executions
GET    /api/v1/executions/:id     # Get execution
POST   /api/v1/executions/:id/retry   # Retry execution
POST   /api/v1/executions/:id/stop    # Stop execution
```

### Credentials
Manage credentials used by workflow nodes for authentication.

```
POST   /api/v1/credentials        # Create credential
GET    /api/v1/credentials        # List credentials
GET    /api/v1/credentials/:id    # Get credential
PATCH  /api/v1/credentials/:id    # Update credential
DELETE /api/v1/credentials/:id    # Delete credential
```

## API Features

### Pagination

List endpoints support cursor-based pagination:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "nextCursor": "eyJsYXN0SWQiOiIxMjM0NSIsImxpbWl0IjoxMDB9"
}
```

Use the `nextCursor` value in subsequent requests:

```bash
GET /api/v1/workflows?cursor=eyJsYXN0SWQiOiIxMjM0NSIsImxpbWl0IjoxMDB9
```

### Filtering

Many endpoints support filtering by various parameters:

```bash
# Filter workflows by name
GET /api/v1/workflows?name=customer

# Filter by active status
GET /api/v1/workflows?active=true

# Filter by project
GET /api/v1/workflows?projectId=abc123
```

### Response Format

All API responses use JSON format:

```json
{
  "id": "workflow123",
  "name": "My Workflow",
  "active": true,
  "nodes": [...],
  "connections": {...}
}
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

| Status Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `200` | Success |
| `201` | Resource created |
| `400` | Bad request - Invalid parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key |
| `403` | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Resource not found |
| `409` | Conflict - Resource state conflict |
| `500` | Internal server error |

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "message": "Workflow with ID \"workflow123\" does not exist",
  "code": "NOT_FOUND"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

n8n implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- **IP-based limits**: 1000 requests per 5 minutes
- **Key-based limits**: Varies by endpoint and operation

<Warning>
Exceeding rate limits returns a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.
</Warning>

## Scopes and Permissions

API keys can have specific scopes that control access:

- `workflow:read` - Read workflow data
- `workflow:create` - Create new workflows
- `workflow:update` - Update existing workflows
- `workflow:delete` - Delete workflows
- `workflow:execute` - Execute workflows
- `credential:read` - Read credentials
- `credential:create` - Create credentials
- `credential:update` - Update credentials
- `credential:delete` - Delete credentials
- `execution:read` - Read execution data
- `execution:list` - List executions

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate an API Key">
    Navigate to Settings → API in your n8n instance and create a new API key with the required scopes.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Make Your First Request">
    Use the API key to authenticate your requests:
    
    ```bash
    curl -H "X-N8N-API-KEY: your-api-key" \
      https://your-n8n-instance.com/api/v1/workflows
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Explore the API">
    Browse the documentation for specific endpoints and try different operations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Appropriate Scopes">
    Only grant the minimum required scopes to your API keys. This follows the principle of least privilege and enhances security.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Handle Errors Gracefully">
    Always check HTTP status codes and handle errors appropriately in your application.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Implement Retry Logic">
    For transient errors (5xx), implement exponential backoff retry logic.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cache When Possible">
    Cache workflow and credential data when appropriate to reduce API calls.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Webhooks">
    For real-time updates, consider using n8n's webhook functionality instead of polling.
