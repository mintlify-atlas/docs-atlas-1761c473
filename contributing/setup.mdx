title: Development Setup
description: Set up your local n8n development environment with pnpm, Node.js, and all required dependencies
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

### Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version **24 or newer** is required for development.

```bash
node --version  # Should be 24.x or higher
```

### pnpm Package Manager

n8n uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) version **10.22 or newer** as its package manager. We recommend installing it with corepack for automatic version management.

<Note>
pnpm workspaces automatically manage file-links between modules that depend on each other in the monorepo.
</Note>

### Corepack

Enable [Node.js corepack](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/corepack.html) to manage pnpm automatically:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@10.22.0 --activate
```

<Warning>
**macOS (Homebrew users):** If you installed Node.js via Homebrew, you need to install corepack separately:

```bash
brew install corepack
```

Homebrew explicitly removes `npm` and `corepack` from the Node.js formula.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Windows users:** Run the corepack commands in a terminal with administrator privileges:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@10.22.0 --activate
```
</Warning>

### Build Tools

Some n8n dependencies require native compilation. Install the appropriate build tools for your operating system:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Debian/Ubuntu
apt-get install -y build-essential python
```

```bash CentOS/RHEL
yum install gcc gcc-c++ make
```

```bash Windows
npm add -g windows-build-tools
```

```bash macOS
# No additional packages required
# Xcode Command Line Tools are sufficient
```

</CodeGroup>

### actionlint (Optional)

If you plan to modify GitHub Actions workflow files, install [actionlint](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint):

```bash
# macOS
brew install actionlint
```

<Note>
actionlint is only required when modifying `.github/workflows/*.yml` files. It runs automatically via git hooks when workflow files change.
</Note>

## Development Container (Optional)

If you use VS Code with Docker, you can use n8n's Dev Container for a pre-configured environment:

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. Click [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) to automatically clone and open n8n in a Dev Container

The Dev Container includes all required tools and dependencies.

## Initial Setup

### For External Contributors

<Steps>

<Step title="Fork the repository">
Go to [n8n-io/n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) and click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner.
</Step>

<Step title="Clone your fork">
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/n8n.git
cd n8n
```
</Step>

<Step title="Add upstream remote">
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n.git
```

This allows you to sync with the original repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
```
</Step>

<Step title="Install dependencies">
```bash
pnpm install
```

This installs all dependencies for all packages and automatically links them together using pnpm workspaces.
</Step>

<Step title="Build all packages">
```bash
pnpm build
```

<Warning>
**Performance tip:** Redirect build output to a file to avoid overwhelming your terminal:

```bash
pnpm build > build.log 2>&1
tail -n 20 build.log  # Check for errors
```
</Warning>
</Step>

</Steps>

### For n8n Team Members

<Steps>

<Step title="Clone the repository">
```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n.git
cd n8n
```
</Step>

<Step title="Install dependencies">
```bash
pnpm install
```
</Step>

<Step title="Build all packages">
```bash
pnpm build > build.log 2>&1
```
</Step>

</Steps>

## Starting n8n

After the initial setup, start n8n in production mode:

```bash
pnpm start
```

n8n will be available at `http://localhost:5678`

## Development Mode

For active development with hot-reload, use development mode:

### Full Stack Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This starts all packages in watch mode with automatic rebuilding and hot-reload.

<Warning>
**Performance impact:** Full development mode runs multiple processes in parallel:
- TypeScript compilation for each package
- File watchers monitoring source files
- Nodemon restarting the backend
- Vite dev server with HMR for frontend
- Build processes for various packages

This can consume significant CPU and memory. See [Selective Development](#selective-development) for optimized workflows.
</Warning>

### Selective Development

Run only the packages you're actively working on for better performance:

<Accordion title="Backend-only development">
```bash
pnpm dev:be
```

Excludes frontend packages like editor-ui and design-system.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Frontend-only development">
```bash
pnpm dev:fe
```

Runs editor-ui and design-system development servers.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="AI/LangChain nodes development">
```bash
pnpm dev:ai
```

Runs only essential packages for AI node development.
</Accordion>

### Most Common Development Workflow

Many n8n developers use this two-terminal setup:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal 1: Backend (CLI)
cd packages/cli
pnpm dev
```

```bash Terminal 2: Frontend (Editor UI)
cd packages/frontend/editor-ui
pnpm dev
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
If you modify code outside `packages/cli` or `packages/frontend/editor-ui`, run `pnpm build` to rebuild those packages.
</Note>

### Custom Node Development

For developing custom nodes with hot-reload:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal 1: Watch nodes package
cd packages/nodes-base
pnpm dev
```

```bash Terminal 2: CLI with hot reload
cd packages/cli
N8N_DEV_RELOAD=true pnpm dev
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
**Performance considerations:**

The `N8N_DEV_RELOAD` feature watches potentially thousands of files. On resource-constrained systems, consider developing without hot reload and manually restarting when needed.
</Warning>

### Testing with Different Configurations

n8n uses [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) to quickly spin up local instances with different configurations:

<Steps>

<Step title="Build a Docker image">
Build from your branch:

```bash
pnpm build:docker
```

Or use an existing image:

```bash
export N8N_DOCKER_IMAGE=n8nio/n8n:latest
```
</Step>

<Step title="Run a stack">
<CodeGroup>

```bash SQLite
pnpm --filter n8n-containers stack:sqlite
```

```bash PostgreSQL
pnpm --filter n8n-containers stack:postgres
```

```bash Queue Mode
pnpm --filter n8n-containers stack:queue
```

```bash Multi-Main (HA)
pnpm --filter n8n-containers stack:multi-main
```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Customize or scale (optional)">
Customize with environment variables:

```bash
pnpm --filter n8n-containers stack --env N8N_ENABLED_MODULES=insights
```

Scale up workers:

```bash
pnpm --filter n8n-containers stack --queue --mains 4 --workers 20
```
</Step>

</Steps>

<Note>
Each instance gets its own port. Multi-main stacks use a load balancer by default. See `packages/testing/containers/README.md` for more details.
</Note>

## Testing with Clean Database

To test features with a fresh n8n instance without losing your existing setup, use a different user folder:

```bash
N8N_USER_FOLDER=~/.n8n-test pnpm --filter n8n start
```

Each folder maintains its own database, settings, and workflows.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Build fails with dependency errors">
1. Clear node_modules and reinstall:
   ```bash
   pnpm reset
   pnpm install
   pnpm build
   ```

2. Ensure you're using the correct Node.js and pnpm versions:
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should be 24.x+
   pnpm --version  # Should be 10.22.0+
   ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Port 5678 is already in use">
Change the port with an environment variable:

```bash
N8N_PORT=5679 pnpm start
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Hot reload not working">
Ensure you're using `N8N_DEV_RELOAD=true` and that the relevant packages are running in watch mode:

```bash
cd packages/nodes-base && pnpm dev  # Terminal 1
cd packages/cli && N8N_DEV_RELOAD=true pnpm dev  # Terminal 2
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Docker alternatives (Podman, Colima)">
Testcontainers requires additional configuration for Docker alternatives:

- **Podman:** Follow [this guide](https://podman-desktop.io/tutorial/testcontainers-with-podman)
- **Colima:** Set environment variables as described [here](https://node.testcontainers.org/supported-container-runtimes/#colima)
</Accordion>
